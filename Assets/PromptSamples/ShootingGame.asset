  - "everytime when Oculus X button is pressed , create only one primitive sphere
    called \"Tom\" of which the size is 0.1f, with rigidbody and collider. Tom will
    run forward out of the left controllert. dont use ienumerator. \r\nTo prevent
    multiple Tom spawns from a single button press in Unity, detect the initial press
    by tracking the button's state change from not pressed to pressed, rather than
    continuously spawning Tom while the button is pressed.\n"
  - create a primitive cube called "Jack" of which the size is 0.5f, with collider
    and rigidbody but the gravity is off, the original position is (1.50f,0.8f,1.5f),
    if Jack is collided by a gameobjct of which the name is Tom, Jack will become
