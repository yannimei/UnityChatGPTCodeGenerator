  - "everytime when Oculus X button is pressed , create only one primitive sphere
    called \"Tom\" of which the size is 0.1f, with rigidbody and collider. Tom will
    run forward out of the left controllert. dont use ienumerator. \r\nTo prevent
    multiple Tom spawns from a single button press in Unity, detect the initial press
    by tracking the button's state change from not pressed to pressed, rather than
    continuously spawning Tom while the button is pressed.\n"
  - pyramid
  - turn off the directional light
  - create a minecraft terrain of which the whole size is 5 * 5, out of primitive
    cubes of which the size is 0.2, give them green color, and make it a bit bumpy
  - if i click the Oculus A button, spawn brown color primitive cylinder, of which
    the size is (0.05,0.2,0.05) on the postion of my right controller. you can freen
    define a brown color rgb value
  - randomely spawn brown color primitive cylinder, of which the size is (0.05,0.2,0.05)
    on the cubes on the terrain. maybe 20 cylinders. you can freen define a brown
    color rgb value
